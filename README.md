# DNSResolver

## How it works

The Domain Name System (DNS) resolver is a feature that sends and receives queries to and from the DNS server on behalf of a client. The mydig.py code is a similar version to the Dig command that performs DNS lookups and displays the answers that are returned from the queried name server(s).

## Libraries used

* sys
* datetime
* dnspython 

## How to run

Execute python mydig.py <domain name>(ex: python mydig.py www.Google.com) to run
